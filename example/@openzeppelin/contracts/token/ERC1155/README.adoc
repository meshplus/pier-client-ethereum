= ERC 1155

This set of interfaces and contracts are all related to the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155[ERC1155 Multi Token Standard].

The EIP consists of three interfaces which fulfill different roles, found here as {IERC1155}, {IERC1155MetadataURI} and {IERC1155Receiver}.

{ERC1155} implements the mandatory {IERC1155} interface, as well as the optional extension {IERC1155MetadataURI}, by relying on the substitution mechanism to use the same URI for all token types, dramatically reducing gas costs.

Additionally there are multiple custom extensions, including:

* designation of addresses that can pause token transfers for all users ({ERC1155Pausable}).
* destruction of own tokens ({ERC1155Burnable}).
